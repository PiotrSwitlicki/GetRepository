Simple application with basic authorization, allowing to get repository data from Github (https://github.com/laravel/laravel).

1. create public repository

2. create application based on Laravel framework 

3. prepare an application with simple login view and form that will accept github URL - after submitting it, it will show a list of releases for given repository with links to download given release.

4. nice to have:

generate CSV with repository data on click

unit tests

API endpoint with repository data (both public API endpoint and separate endpoint for authorized users)

custom artisan command that will allow to create users and change password
